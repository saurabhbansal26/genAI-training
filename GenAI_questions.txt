	 HuggingFace models (sentence-transformers)

==> when to use faiss-cpu and faiss-gpu for FAISS vector store DB?
Answer : faiss-cpu, Use when:
		a) You are working locally or on a small dataset (thousands to a few million vectors).
		b) You don’t have a GPU available.
		c) Quick prototyping or testing.
		d) Memory and compute requirements are moderate.

		Pros:
		  a) Easy to install (pip install faiss-cpu).
		  b) Works on any machine without CUDA.

		Cons:
		  a) Slower for very large datasets or high-dimensional vectors.


	faiss-gpu, Use when:
		a) You are working with large datasets (millions to billions of vectors).
		b) High-dimensional embeddings (e.g., 1536+ dimensions).
		c) Need fast search and indexing performance.
		d) You have access to a CUDA-enabled GPU.

		Pros:
		  a) Significantly faster search and training for large-scale data.
		  b) Supports GPU parallelism for large vector indices.

		Cons:
		  a) Requires CUDA drivers and a compatible GPU.
		  b) Installation is slightly more complex.
